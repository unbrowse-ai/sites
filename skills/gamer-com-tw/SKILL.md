# Unbrowse for Gamer (gamer.com.tw)

Gamer as tools for your agent. Unofficial: not affiliated with or endorsed by gamer.com.tw. Unbrowse compiled these from gamer.com.tw's own requests: each call replays the site's first-party API server-side and returns a verified result. No scraping of rendered pages, no browser on your side, no gamer.com.tw API key.

## Connect the gamer.com.tw MCP

This server is a tool scope holding only gamer.com.tw: its compiled tools plus the Unbrowse tools that run them, so the agent's tool list stays small and every call stays on gamer.com.tw.

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http gamer-com-tw https://unbrowse.ai/mcp/gamer.com.tw
codex mcp add gamer-com-tw --url https://unbrowse.ai/mcp/gamer.com.tw && codex mcp login gamer-com-tw
```

```json
{"mcpServers":{"gamer-com-tw":{"url":"https://unbrowse.ai/mcp/gamer.com.tw"}}}
```

The first connect signs in to Unbrowse with OAuth (free tier, only verified results count). For scripts, send `Authorization: Bearer $UNBROWSE_API_KEY` (key from https://unbrowse.ai/app/keys; keep it in a secret manager, never in config you commit).

If none of the tools below are in this session's tool list, the server is not connected or not signed in: say so and stop. Do not fetch gamer.com.tw some other way and present it as this skill's result.

## Tools

### `forum_gamer_com_tw__get_b_php` — Browse a forum board

Browse a forum board. Inputs: bsn. Returns the page's title, readable text and links. Read-only on forum.gamer.com.tw.

- `bsn` (integer, required)

```json
{"bsn":"<bsn>"}
```

### `gnn_gamer_com_tw__get_detail_php` — Read a news article

Read a news article. Inputs: sn. Returns the page's title, readable text and links. Read-only on gnn.gamer.com.tw.

- `sn` (integer, required)

```json
{"sn":"<sn>"}
```

### `gnn_gamer_com_tw__read_page` — Browse latest news

Browse latest news. Inputs: path. Returns the page's title, readable text and links. Read-only on gnn.gamer.com.tw.

- `path` (string, required) — A page on gnn.gamer.com.tw: a path like /about, or a full URL on gnn.gamer.com.tw

```json
{"path":"/"}
```

Always there too: `unbrowse.run` (a task on gamer.com.tw in plain words), `unbrowse.inspect`, `unbrowse.resume`, `unbrowse.scrape` and `unbrowse.map` (any page on gamer.com.tw), and the recorded cloud browser `unbrowse.browse.open` → `unbrowse.browse.act` → `unbrowse.browse.finish`. Hosts that reject dotted names show them with `_` (`unbrowse_run`).

## How to call

1. Pick the tool whose title matches the job and pass its inputs. Leave the site's recorded parameters out unless the user asked for something they control.
2. Read `status`. `succeeded` carries the verified `result`. `input_required` is not a failure: answer the open fields with `unbrowse.resume {runId, answers}` on the same run.
3. No tool fits: `unbrowse.run {task}`. It fails with `no_capability` when nothing is compiled for that yet: do it once with `unbrowse.browse.open` on gamer.com.tw → `unbrowse.browse.act` → `unbrowse.browse.finish`, which compiles a new tool this server lists next time. Anything off gamer.com.tw is refused here (`not_in_scope`): use the general Unbrowse server for that.
4. Signing in: never ask the user for a password. `unbrowse.browse.act` with `action: "autofill"` fills gamer.com.tw's login from their Unbrowse password manager.
5. Report only what a `succeeded` result says. `outcome_unknown` means a change may have happened: check before retrying. Posting, buying, sending or deleting needs the user's go-ahead.

## Without MCP

Every tool is also a REST call:

```sh
curl -s https://unbrowse.ai/api/v1/sites/forum.gamer.com.tw/call/forum_gamer_com_tw__get_b_php \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $UNBROWSE_API_KEY" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bsn":"<bsn>"}'
```

OpenAPI: https://unbrowse.ai/api/v1/sites/forum.gamer.com.tw/openapi.json. Every other site: the general Unbrowse skill (https://github.com/unbrowse-ai/unbrowse) and https://unbrowse.ai/mcp.
